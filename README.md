# Code of Dynamic Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm ATAP

This repository contains the code implementation of the ATAP (Adaptive Two-stage Archiving andautoencoder Prediction) algorithm for dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization.

## Overview

ATAP is a dynamic optimization algorithm designed to tackle multi-objective optimization problems under constraints. It adapts to changes in the environment and constraints dynamically, providing robust and efficient solutions.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qianzhezhi/DCMOEA_ATAP.git
    ```


2. Run the algorithm with your own problem instances or data.

## Note

This code repository does not include the benchmark section used in the original article. You may integrate your preferred benchmarking suite or datasets as required.
